# coursera_capstone
Repository for the coursera capstone project files; most relating to data science processes; renamed the files to relate to the skills used, the naming of the files are not changed from files provided to ensure it is still referenced correctly (Could have changed the name beforehand in hindsight)

The majority of the files in this repository is a premade skeleton code of the task that needs to be completed; tasks are scattered throughout the notebooks where certain skills taught are tested on; for the most part they are straightforward although sometimes not as much. The valorant_project is technically my first data science project since that one is done on my own. However, this repository still showcases what I have learned in the course.
