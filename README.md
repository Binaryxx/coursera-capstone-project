# ibm_capstone
repository for the ibm capstone project files; most relating to data science processes

The majority of the files in this repository is a premade skeleton code of the task that needs to be completed; tasks are scattered throughout the notebooks where certain skills taught are tested on; for the most part they are straightforward althought sometimes not as much. The valorant_project is technically my first data science project since that one is done on my own. However, this repository still showcases what I have learned in the course.
